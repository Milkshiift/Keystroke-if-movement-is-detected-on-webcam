# Keystroke if movement is detected on a webcam

Script that can press keyboard keys when movement is detected on camera

Why this python code is cool:

 - You can define your region of interest
 - Works with light changes
 - Works 99.999% of the time
 - Performant, uses 0-1.5% of CPU and 50 mb of RAM

P.S.: I was making it to detect a door opening so comments are centered around it.
